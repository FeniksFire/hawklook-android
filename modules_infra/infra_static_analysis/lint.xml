    Too many complaints about overriding background which is set in Theme.
    We could possibly remove background from theme and set it on every root layout, but it's such a big deal nowadays to spend time on it.

  <!--
    Using Kotlin extensions' @Parcelize makes Lint complaining:
    "This class implements Parcelable but does not provide a CREATOR field"

    Hopefully, one day it would be fixed. Currently, it works in AS but fails in Gradle so needs to be ignored.
